# MerchandiseManagement

My family owns and manages a gift shop near Disneyland. Their current method of tracking and maintaining merchandise stock 
is simply “eyeballing” the supply in the stock room and scribbling it on a scrap piece of paper. Penmanship is often messy 
and hard to read--especially when the pen ink smears or the pencil marks fade--and a physical paper list is also prone to 
getting lost.

This GUI program was created to act as a database to help my family more efficiently manage inventory, streamline stock 
management, and prevent loss of sales due to out-of-stock items with options to add, delete, edit, and search for items. 
Most importantly, the program displays a prominent notifications list to highlight when stock of an item is too low.
